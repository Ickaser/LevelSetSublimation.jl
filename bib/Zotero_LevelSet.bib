  abstract = {In this paper, we first describe a fourth order accurate finite difference discretization for both the Laplace equation and the heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on irregular domains. In the case of the heat equation we use an implicit discretization in time to avoid the stringent time step restrictions associated with requirements for explicit schemes. We then turn our focus to the Stefan problem and construct a third order accurate method that also includes an implicit time discretization. Multidimensional computational results are presented to demonstrate the order accuracy of these numerical methods.},

  abstract = {A partial differential equation based reinitialization method is presented in the framework of a localized level set method. Two formulations of the new reinitialization scheme are derived. These formulations are modifications of the partial differential equation introduced by Sussman et al. [M. Sussman, P. Smereka, S. Osher, A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow, J. Comput. Phys. 114 (1994) 146\textendash 159] and, in particular, improvements of the second-order accurate modification proposed by Russo and Smereka [G. Russo, P. Smereka, A remark on computing distance functions, J. Comput. Phys. 163 (2000) 51\textendash 67]. The first formulation uses the least-squares method to explicitly minimize the displacement of the zero level set within the reinitialization. The overdetermined problem, which is solved in the first formulation of the new reinitialization scheme, is reduced to a determined problem in another formulation such that the location of the interface is locally preserved within the reinitialization. The second formulation is derived by systematically minimizing the number of constraints imposed on the reinitialization scheme. For both systems, the resulting algorithms are formulated in a three-dimensional frame of reference and are remarkably simple and efficient. The new formulations are second-order accurate at the interface when the reinitialization equation is solved with a first-order upwind scheme and do not diminish the accuracy of high-order discretizations of the level set equation. The computational work required for all components of the localized level set method scales with O\dh N \TH. Detailed analyses of numerical solutions obtained with different discretization schemes evidence the enhanced accuracy and the stability of the proposed method, which can be used for localized and global level set methods.},

  publisher = {{Springer}},
  address = {{New York}},
  abstract = {This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While the book gives many examples of the usefulness of the methods for a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with the description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, and then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, reinitialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method, and the motion of codimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the field of image processing and computer vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to computational physics. It begins with one-phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke; free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water; and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change it's topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful},

The methodology and code-validation are presented in-detail for heat and/or mass transfer induced Stefan flow, 2D Cartesian as well as axi-symmetric coordinate system and Dirichlet as well as jump boundary conditions at the interface. For the Dirichlet BC, a higher order extrapolation methodology is presented \textendash{} for the computation of ghost fluid value across the interface. Whereas, for the jump BC, a generic finite volume method based discretized equation is proposed \textendash{} consisting of additional source term and modification in diffusion coefficient for the control-volumes adjoining the interface. An excellent agreement between the present and published results are shown separately for Stefan flow problems induced by heat transfer (melting as well as solidification), mass transfer (isothermal evaporation) and heat as well as mass transfer (non-isothermal evaporation). Finally, a performance study is presented demonstrating a superior performance of the present sharp as compared to diffused interface level set method. The performance study is also presented for two different methods of computation of normal gradient across the interface, with regard to numerical oscillations in the results.The present work \textendash involving localized fluid flow and heat as well as mass transfer in the two-phase domain \textendash{} will be extremely useful to CFD developer on multi-phase flow.},
