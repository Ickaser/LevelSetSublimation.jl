  abstract = {The level set method [S. Osher and J. A. Sethian, J. Comput. Phys., 79 (1988), pp. 12\textendash 49] has become a widely used numerical method for moving interfaces; e.g., see the many examples in [J. Sethian, Level Set Methods: Evolving Interfaces in Geometry, Fluid Mechanics, Computer Vision and Material Science, Cambridge University Press, London, 1996; S. Osher and R. Fedkiw, Level Set Methods and Dynamic Implicit Surfaces, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 2002]. For many applications, the velocity of the interface is known only on the interface, while the level set method requires information about the interface speed at least in a neighborhood of grid points near the interface. To address this issue, velocity extensions are used to map the velocity information on the interface into the rest of the computational domain [D. Adalsteinsson and J. Sethian, J. Comput. Phys., 118 (1995), pp. 269\textendash 277]. This allows the level set method to proceed. The velocity extension method presented in [D. Adalsteinsson and J. Sethian, J. Comput. Phys., 118 (1995), pp. 269\textendash 277] uses the fast marching method [J. Sethian, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 93 (1996), pp. 1591\textendash 1595; J. Sethian, SIAM Rev., 41 (1999), pp. 199\textendash 235], and is only a first-order approximation for the velocity field near the interface. Furthermore, it can lead to unexpected behavior in some cases. This is primarily due to the strictly local solution for the characteristics of the flow near the interface. In this paper, we look more closely at the characteristics near the interface, and then present a modified velocity extension method, also based on the fast marching method, which handles the characteristcs more accurately. In turn, this new method will lead to some interesting new possibilities for the fast marching method.},

The resulting algorithm, which is particularly well suited for the treatment of material interfaces in compressible multi-phase flows, is based on: (i) high order of accuracy in space obtained through WENO reconstruction, (ii) a high order one-step time discretization via a local space\textendash time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method, and (iii) the use of a path conservative scheme for handling the non-conservative terms of the equations. The AMR property with time accurate local time stepping, which has been treated according to a cell-by-cell strategy, strongly relies on the high order one-step time discretization, which naturally allows a high order accurate and consistent computation of the jump terms at interfaces between elements using different time steps. The new scheme has been successfully validated on some test problems for the Baer\textendash Nunziato model of compressible multiphase flows.},

  abstract = {The reinitialization, which is required to regularize the level set function, can be computationally expensive and hence is a determining factor for the overall efficiency of a level set method. However, it often has a significantly adverse impact on the accuracy of the level set solution. This short note is meant to shed light on the efficiency and accuracy issues of the reinitialization process. Using just one clearly defined level set propagation test case with an analytical solution the solutions obtained using a recently proposed efficient lower-order constrained reinitialization (CR) scheme and standard low- and high-order reinitialization schemes are juxtaposed to evidence the superiority of the novel CR formulation. It is shown that maintaining the location of the zero level set during the reinitialization is crucial for the accuracy and that the displacement caused by standard high-order reinitialization schemes clearly outweighs the benefit of the high-order smoothing of the level set function. Finally, results of a three-dimensional problem are concisely reported to demonstrate the general applicability of the CR scheme. Copyright q 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A partial differential equation based reinitialization method is presented in the framework of a localized level set method. Two formulations of the new reinitialization scheme are derived. These formulations are modifications of the partial differential equation introduced by Sussman et al. [M. Sussman, P. Smereka, S. Osher, A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow, J. Comput. Phys. 114 (1994) 146\textendash 159] and, in particular, improvements of the second-order accurate modification proposed by Russo and Smereka [G. Russo, P. Smereka, A remark on computing distance functions, J. Comput. Phys. 163 (2000) 51\textendash 67]. The first formulation uses the least-squares method to explicitly minimize the displacement of the zero level set within the reinitialization. The overdetermined problem, which is solved in the first formulation of the new reinitialization scheme, is reduced to a determined problem in another formulation such that the location of the interface is locally preserved within the reinitialization. The second formulation is derived by systematically minimizing the number of constraints imposed on the reinitialization scheme. For both systems, the resulting algorithms are formulated in a three-dimensional frame of reference and are remarkably simple and efficient. The new formulations are second-order accurate at the interface when the reinitialization equation is solved with a first-order upwind scheme and do not diminish the accuracy of high-order discretizations of the level set equation. The computational work required for all components of the localized level set method scales with O\dh N \TH. Detailed analyses of numerical solutions obtained with different discretization schemes evidence the enhanced accuracy and the stability of the proposed method, which can be used for localized and global level set methods.},

  abstract = {This book is an introduction to level set methods and dynamic implicit surfaces. These are powerful techniques for analyzing and computing moving fronts in a variety of different settings. While the book gives many examples of the usefulness of the methods for a diverse set of applications, it also gives complete numerical analysis and recipes, which will enable users to quickly apply the techniques to real problems. The book begins with the description of implicit surfaces and their basic properties, and then devises the level set geometry and calculus toolbox, including the construction of signed distance functions. Part II adds dynamics to this static calculus. Topics include the level set equation itself, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, motion of a surface normal to itself, reinitialization to a signed distance function, extrapolation in the normal direction, the particle level set method, and the motion of codimension two (and higher) objects. Part III is concerned with topics taken from the field of image processing and computer vision. These include the restoration of images degraded by noise and blur, image segmentation with active contours (snakes), and reconstruction of surfaces from unorganized data points. Part IV is dedicated to computational physics. It begins with one-phase compressible fluid dynamics, then two-phase compressible flow involving possibly different equations of state, detonation and deflagration waves, and solid/fluid structure interaction. Next it discusses incompressible fluid dynamics, including a computer graphics simulation of smoke; free surface flows, including a computer graphics simulation of water; and fully two-phase incompressible flow. Additional related topics include incompressible flames with applications to computer graphics and coupling a compressible and incompressible fluid. Finally, heat flow and Stefan problems are discussed. A student or researcher working in mathematics, computer graphics, science, or engineering interested in any dynamic moving front, which might change it's topology or develop singularities, will find this book interesting and useful},

  abstract = {High order accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes are relatively new but have gained rapid popularity in numerical solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and other convection dominated problems. The main advantage of such schemes is their capability to achieve arbitrarily high order formal accuracy in smooth regions while maintaining stable, nonoscillatory, and sharp discontinuity transitions. The schemes are thus especially suitable for problems containing both strong discontinuities and complex smooth solution features. WENO schemes are robust and do not require the user to tune parameters. At the heart of the WENO schemes is actually an approximation procedure not directly related to PDEs, hence the WENO procedure can also be used in many non-PDE applications. In this paper we review the history and basic formulation of WENO schemes, outline the main ideas in using WENO schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs and other convection dominated problems, and present a collection of applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, computational astronomy and astrophysics, semiconductor device simulation, traffic flow models, computational biology, and some non-PDE applications. Finally, we mention a few topics concerning WENO schemes that are currently under investigation.},
